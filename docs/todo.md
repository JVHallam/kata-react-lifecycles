packages and setup:
todo:
* Change the index.js file so that a bunch of shit can be rendered to the dom, visually explaining each test.
* Get a guide written, alongside the entire situation

* Get the readme written

## rendering situations to the browser:

* Check that the cleanup is called on dismount

* Component reports any error during rendering to the server
* Component doesn't call for a report, if there were no errors during rendering
* Expect the element to display the error, when an error is thrown
